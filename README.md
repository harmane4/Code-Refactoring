# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor Homework Assignment
## Description

For this project I cleaned up and refracted the index.html and style.css files to make them more accesbile. 

This site was more more accessible to ensure that people with disabilities can access the website by adding accessible alt attributes to the images. SEO was increased as the codebase was improved in that all links work, and the style.css file was made more efficient by consolidation the selectors as well as commented and properties and index.html file was organised to follow a semantic structure of HTML element. 

Problems that were solved was insuring all links worked, the index.html followed a semantic structure, the style.css file was updated so that the selectors and properties were consolidated and organzied to follow a semantic structure as well being as properly commented.

 I learnt how to trouble shoot issues when I could not get my page to deploy on github.
